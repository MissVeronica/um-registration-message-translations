# UM Registration Message Translations
Custom template for UM registration message translations when role settings message is empty
## UM User Roles -> Edit Registration Role -> "Registration Options"
Select "Show custom message" and save "Personalize the custom message" as blank

## Installation
### UM Guide
Read the UM guide about "Template structure & Overriding templates via a theme" https://docs.ultimatemember.com/article/1516-templates-map
### Download template
Download the <code>message.php</code> script file from this link and upload the template file to your Active theme's folder 

* Active theme's folder: .../wp-content/themes/{active theme}/ultimate-member/templates/message.php

* Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MissVeronica/um-registration-message-translations/refs/heads/main/message.php

Create the folders ( ultimate-member, templates ) with your filemanager or FTP client if non existent.
### Verify installation
Verify correct installation with "UM Settings -> Advanced -> Override templates" that UM is locating the template at .../ultimate-member/templates/message.php

If you don't find the 'Override templates' tab the template file <code>message.php</code> is either not uploaded or uploaded to the wrong folder/wrong file name.
